    abstract = { Abstract Many datasets can be described in the form of graphs or networks where nodes in the graph represent entities and edges represent relationships between pairs of entities. A common property of these networks is their community structure, considered as clusters of densely connected groups of vertices, with only sparser connections between groups. The identification of such communities relies on some notion of clustering or density measure. which defines the communities that can be found. However, previous community detection methods usually apply the same structural measure on all kinds of networks, despite their distinct dissimilar features. In this paper, we present a new community mining measure, Max-Min Modularity, which considers both connected pairs and criteria defined by domain experts in finding communities, and then specify a hierarchical clustering algorithm to detect communities in networks. When applied to real world networks for which the community structures are already known, our method shows improvement over previous algorithms. In addition, when applied to randomly generated networks for which we only have approximate information about communities, it gives promising results which shows the algorithm's robustness against noise. }

  abstract     = {One of the important issues in social networks is the social communities which are formed by interactions between its members. Three types of community including overlapping, non-overlapping, and hidden are detected by different approaches. Regarding the importance of community detection in social networks, this paper provides a systematic mapping of machine learning-based community detection approaches. The study aimed to show the type of communities in social networks along with the algorithms of machine learning that have been used for community detection. After carrying out the steps of mapping and removing useless references, 246 papers were selected to answer the questions of this research. The results of the research indicated that unsupervised machine learning-based algorithms with 41.46% (such as k means) are the most used categories to detect communities in social networks due to their low processing overheads. On the other hand, there has been a significant increase in the use of deep learning since 2020 which has sufficient performance for community detection in large-volume data. With regard to the ability of NMI to measure the correlation or similarity between communities, with 53.25%, it is the most frequently used metric to evaluate the performance of community identifications. Furthermore, considering availability, low in size, and lack of multiple edge and loops, dataset Zachary’s Karate Club with 26.42% is the most used dataset for community detection research in social networks.},

title = {A Multiagent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the Community Detection Problem}, 
volume = {19},

abstract ={Recent researches show that diverse systems in many different areas can be represented as complex networks. Examples of these include the Internet, social networks and so on. In each case, the system can be modeled as a complex and very large network consisting of a large number of entities and associations between them. Most of these networks are generally sparse in global yet dense in local. They have vertices in a group structure and the vertices within a group have higher density of edges while vertices among groups have lower density of edges. Such a structure is called community and is one of the important features of the network and is able to reveal many hidden characteristics of the networks. Today, community detection is used to improve the efficiency of search engines and discovery of terrorist organizations on the World Wide Web.   Community detection is a challenging NP-hard optimization problem that consists of searching for communities. It is assumed that the nodes of the same community share some properties that enable the detection of new characteristics or functional relationships in a network. Although there are many algorithms developed for community detection, most of them are unsuitable when dealing with large networks due to their computational cost.  Nowadays, multiagent systems have been used to solve different problems, such as constraint satisfaction problems and combinatorial optimization problems with satisfactory results. In this paper, a new multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for community detection in complex networks. Each agent in the multiagent system is an autonomous entity with different learning parameters. Based on the cooperation among the learning agents and updating the action probabilities of each agent, the algorithm interactively will identify a set of communities in the input network that are more densely connected than other communities. In other words, some independent agents interactively attempt to identify communities and evaluate the quality of the communities found at each stage by the normalized cut as objective function; then, the probability vectors of the agents are updated based on the results of the evaluation. If the quality of the community found by an agent in each of the stages is better than all the results produced so far, then it is referred to as the successful agent and the other agents will update their probability vectors based on the result of the successful agent.   In the experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated on four real-world benchmark networks: the Karate club network, Dolphins network, Political books network and College football network, and synthetic LFR benchmark graphs with scales of 1000 and 5000 nodes. LFR networks are suitable for systematically measuring the property of an algorithm.  Experimental results show that proposed approach has a good performance and is able to find suitable communities in large and small scale networks and is capable of detecting the community in complex networks In terms of speed, precision and stability. Moreover, according to the systematic comparison of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm with four state-of-the-art community detection algorithms, our algorithm outperforms the these algorithms in terms of modularity and NMI; also, it can detect communities in small and large scale networks with high speed, accuracy, and stability, where it is capable of managing large-scale networks up to 5000 nodes. },

abstract = {Identifying communities is one of the hardest tasks in network analysis, and it is critical in various fields, including computer science, biology, sociology, and physics. It aims to partition the graph of a network into groups/clusters of nodes (communities) according to the graph topology. Because determining the optimal partition is a computationally difficult task, it is usually carried out using optimization methods. Most optimization methods proposed for this problem have considered network modularity as the objective function. This article proposes a new evolutionary algorithm called LGA to tackle the community detection problem through modularity optimization. In LGA, learning automata are utilized in the evolution process of the genetic algorithm. Utilizing learning automata in the evolution process of the genetic algorithm largely prevents getting stuck in local optima and premature convergence of the genetic algorithm. It has been tested on different examples of the community detection problem to assess the performance of the LGA. The experiment results showed that the LGA efficiently detects communities within networks. On average, its performance is 26.47% better in real-world networks and 48.32% better in synthetic networks than in compared algorithms.}

abstract = {Community structure is an important characteristic of complex networks. It determines where important functions of a network are located. Recently, discovering community structure in complex networks has become a hot topic of research. However, the continuous increase in network size has made network structure more complex, and community detection has become extremely difficult in real applications. In particular, the detection results are usually not accurate enough when classical clustering methods are applied to high-dimensional data matrices. In this paper, inspired by the relationship between vertices, we design a novel and effective network adjacency matrix transformation method to describe vertices’ similarity in the network topology. On this basis, we propose a framework to extract nonlinear features: community detection with deep transitive autoencoder (CDDTA). This framework can obtain powerful nonlinear features of a real network to make community detection algorithms perform excellently in practice. We further incorporate unsupervised transfer learning into the CDDTA (Transfer-CDDTA) by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence of embedded instances, to discover powerful low-dimensional representations. Finally, we propose a new training strategy and optimization method for our algorithm. Extensive experimental results indicate that our new framework can ensure good performance on both real-world networks and artificial benchmark networks, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods for community detection in social networks.}

However, the classic methods of community detection, such as spectral clustering and statistical inference, are falling by the wayside as deep learning techniques demonstrate an increasing capacity to handle high-dimensional graph data with impressive performance. Thus, a survey of current progress in community detection through deep learning is timely.

abstract = {In this paper we discuss a very simple approach of combining content and link information in graph structures for the purpose of community discovery, a fundamental task in network analysis. Our approach hinges on the basic intuition that many networks contain noise in the link structure and that content information can help strengthen the community signal. This enables ones to eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and false negatives), which is particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scale information networks.Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between two nodes in the network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link strength is estimated based on whether the link is likely (with high probability) to reside within a community. Content similarity is estimated through cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient.We discuss a simple mechanism for fusing content and link similarity. We then present a biased edge sampling procedure which retains edges that are locally relevant for each graph node. The resulting backbone graph can be clustered using standard community discovery algorithms such as Metis and Markov clustering.Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets (Flickr, Wikipedia and CiteSeer) with varying sizes and characteristics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods over state-of-the-art learning and mining approaches several of which also attempt to combine link and content analysis for the purposes of community discovery. Specifically we always find a qualitative benefit when combining content with link analysis. Additionally our biased graph sampling approach realizes a quantitative benefit in that it is typically several orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.},
